  caption: 'Left: John Milton, author of Paradise Lost; right: a Chinese artefact
    at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. Milton''s writing and the artefacts of the
    Pitt Rivers Museum are both textual inspirations featured in _His Dark Materials_,
    a three volume series by Philip Pullman that is studied in CMS.796. The circular
    Chinese artefact above closely resembles Pullman''s alethiometer. (Left image
